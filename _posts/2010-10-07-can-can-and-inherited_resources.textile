h2. Problem:

My subscription does not have a subscriber.

{% highlight ruby %}
  SubscriptionsController << InheritedResources::Base
    belongs_to :subscriber
    load_and_authorize_resource

    def create
      @subscription = build_resource
      # do something with subscription
      create!
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}


In `def create`, `@subscription.sbscriber` is nil.  This *should* be populated by InheritedResources during #build_resource.

{% highlight ruby %}
  def build_resource
    get_resource_ivar || set_resource_ivar(end_of_association_chain.send(method_for_build, params[resource_instance_name] || {}))
  end
{% endhighlight %}

  Unfortunately, Cancan's load_resource is populating the @subscription instance var, so build_resource simply returns the value of the instance var.

h2. Solution:

Don't ask cancan to load the resource.

{% highlight ruby %}
  SubscriptionsController << InheritedResources::Base
    belongs_to :subscriber
    authorize_resource

    def create
      @subscription = build_resource
    	# do something with subscription
      create!
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}
