Update (2009-06-12 17:18)

I, incorrectly, created my repo as mattscilipoti instead of mattscilipoti.github.com.  After staring at "Page does not exist!" for a few hours, I put in a support resuest.  After a short wait, I found out that:
<ol id="comments">
<li id="comment_199591" class="staffer">
<p class="meta">
</p>
<img class="avatar" width="32" height="32" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/472814aac7576b67da59ea79fcbf7d66?s=32&d=http://github.com/images/gravatars/gravatar-50.png" alt="Tekkub's Avatar"/>
<div class="body">
<div>
<p>I don't think Pages setup fires on a repo rename, only the initial create. Delete your repo, recreate it, and re-push and you should get a PM that the page has built.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li id="comment_199605">
</li>
</ol>

Edit.  Delete.  Create.  git push.  Wait a few minutes.  tada.  What you see.
