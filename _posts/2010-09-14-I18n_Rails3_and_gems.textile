You're building a Rails 3 app.  
It needs to support internationalization.  
No problem.  Rails 3 supports internationalization.  

You can use *translate(key)* or *t(key)*.  

{% highlight haml %}

%h2= t('hello')

{% endhighlight %}

It looks up the key in config/locales/en.yml:

{% highlight yaml %}

en:
  hello:
    Hey y'all

{% endhighlight %}

Yielding...

h2. Hey y'all

But, we're in Rails.  We expect conventions.

Platformatec has a nice "listing of Rails I18n conventions":http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2010/02/rails-3-i18n-changes/.

On our project, we use simple_form, inherited_resources, and cancan.  
Each one has a convention for I18n.  
Each one different.

Luckily, the functionality doesn't overlap... much.

Rails covers 
InheritedResources covers flash.
SimpleForm deals with label, hint, and error.
cancan presents an invalid login message.
